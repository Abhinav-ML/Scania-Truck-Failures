# Scania-Truck-Failures
## Technologies : Machine Learning Technology
## Domain:  Transportation
## Problem Statement :
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle thatuses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing
the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the
easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.
This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the
failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class
indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

AIM : To reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.

## **Steps Involved**
* Step 1: created a python script to dump our data from local to mongodb
* Step 2: performed EDA, FeatureEngineering and Model building on JupyterNotebook and google colab
    ### Perform the step2 in modular programing way:
* step 3: created setup.py file for the distribution purpose of my source code
* step 4: created project file/folder structure
* step 5: implemented logger concepts
* step 6: implemente Custom exception concepts
* step 7
